When running, it will ask you if you are finding the day number of a leap year or a common year. If you are finding the day number for a leap year, then press y and enter to continue, else press n and enter to continue. Y means yes and N means no. As long as the first letter is y or n, the program will procede; otherwise you will get an error.
Enter an integer value for the day number you are trying to find, make sure the integer value is between the specified values in the brackets. 
The program should return the day of the year that day number is (1 is January 1st; 2 is January 2nd; 31 is January 31 and etc) 
Leap year values will be shifted over by one after value 60
This also means that leap year can have a 366th value
